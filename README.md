## Overview

This repository contains a collection of lab exercises for learning and practicing MySQL. It covers topics ranging from basic SQL commands to more advanced database concepts like joins, indexing, and transactions. Each lab file includes both the SQL code and a description of the tasks, allowing you to understand the context and purpose of each exercise.



## Prerequisites
